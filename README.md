# Recent Issue that has been fixed 🔥

<p align='center'> I have tested this tool a number of times. It used to add fast[No Delay]. But nowadays Telegram is enforcing early restrictions on users
  for API spams. So I have to give delays of about 20s, 30s, etc. Now I am not facing these issues anymore. U can try to add at Null sleep time but chances of account
  to get limited are more.
